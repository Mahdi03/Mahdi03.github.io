        <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
        <p>
        HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language. It is the frame or the building block to most websites in and
        around the web. If you want to see the HTML used in websites, just go to any website and press these three
        keys: Ctrl + Shift + I. If you have function keys, F12 works also. Anyway, HTML is not so hard to understand.
        When making your own website, you will find that you won't be using too much HTML. You'll be using your basic
        everyday words even more. HTML has a pattern that is easy to remember. So when you are writing something, you
        will not forget what code to write at the end. But, enough said, lets move on to CSS.

            This Portion of The Website Only Took <strong> 7 minutes </strong> and <strong>34 lines of code</strong> to make.

        <p>Once you get the hang of it, it is <strong>NOT SO HARD</strong>.</p>
