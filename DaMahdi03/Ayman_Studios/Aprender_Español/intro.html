    <h2>Introduction To Aprender Español</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Welcome to <em><strong>Aprender Español</strong></em>, which translates to <em><strong>To Learn Spanish</strong></em> in English. Here, everyday you will complete an interactive lesson. Things will start slow, but they will get trickier
        over time. We <strong>will</strong> assume that you understand English, especially if you can understand this. Since you are learning, it will involve speaking, and so you will need to speak into the microphone clearly. For this reason, use Google
        Chrome and have a microphone handy! Each lesson will teach you something new, and/or build on pre-existing topics. In order to better your understanding in Spanish, each lesson is accompanied by an activity that has 3 parts:
    </p>
    <hr />
    <ol>
        <li><b><u>The <i>Ready</i> Section:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>This section introduces topics that will come up, and topics that will be learned later.</li>
                <li>This section is not designed to be difficult, it is just an introduction to future lessons.</li>
                <li>It lets you know what will come up in the near future.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <hr />
        <li><b><u>The <i>Set</i> Section:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>This section is designed for practice on things that were introduced in the current section.</li>
                <li>This section is a little bit more tricky, and it is designed to make you think.</li>
                <li>This section is more in-depth than the <b><u><i>Ready</i></u></b> Section.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <hr />
        <li><b><u>The <i>Go</i> Section:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>This section is designed to go over previously learnt topics.</li>
                <li>It is used to remember things in the past, that way you don't forget them as you move on.</li>
                <li>This section will be difficult for some, but it will encourage mastery in previously introduced topics.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;And together, they make up the <mark>Ready, Set, Go</mark> assignments, from now on referred to as the <mark>RSG</mark>s.</p>
